# Example 9

- Location: Building 227 UPenn/Gray's Ferry (abandoned Dupont chemistry lab)
- Cameras:
   . ovc (stereo 2 x 1280x1024)
- Calibration: equidistant
- Source bag: unknown
- detector: MIT
- frames: 16485
- Remark: Large run with no odom, but tags fixed.
  Some outlier rig poses. Some really
  large errors, for tags, 78, 104, 103, 57, that may be out of place.
  Needs more investigation. Runs reasonably fast though.
