# Example 20

- Location: Pennstock
- Cameras:
   . 4 PointGrey 1280x1200 Python 3000 monchrome
- Calibration: equidistant (fisheye)
- Source bag: day2  (day2)
- detector: MIT
- frames: 3001
- Remark: THIS TEST EXITS WITH AN ERROR! This is on purpose, to test
          handling of optimizer going singular. Also exercise planar
          constraint and camera-selective remapping. To make it run
          successfully, reduce the rotation_noise on tag 45 to 0.1.
